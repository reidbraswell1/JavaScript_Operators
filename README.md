# JavaScript_Operators

## Steps

1. Fork this repository to start a new project in your repos folder == git clone <JavaScript_Operators>
2. cd JavaScript_Operators to navigate into your new repo directory
3. Type the command code . to open VSC with the JavaScript_Operators folder
4. Open the app.js file

## Exercise 1

1. Declare 2 variables, `a` and `b`, and assign 20 to `a` and 4 to `b`
2. Declare a variable `add` that uses the `+` operator to store the result of adding the values stored in `a` and `b`
3. Declare a variable `minus` that uses the `-` operator to store the result of subtracting the values stored in `a` and `b`
4. Declare a variable `multiply` that uses the `*` operator to store the result of multiplying the values stored in `a` and `b`
5. Declare a variable `dividing` that uses the `/` operator to store the result of dividing the values stored in `a` and `b`

You can print the value of the variables to the browser console (ex: `console.log(add)`) to check the result.

## Exercise 2

1. Use the following code to answer the questions below:

```
let a = 11;
let str = "11";
let str2 = "eleven";
let isPresent = true;
let firstName = "Jackie";
let lastName = "Chan";
```

- What is the value of: a + str?
- What is the value of: a + str2?
- What is the value of: a + isPresent?
- What is the value of: a + firstName?
- What is the value of: a + lastName?

Use the code above to test and print the results.

## Exercise 3

1. Use the following code to answer the questions below:

```
let a = 5;
let str = "5";
let str2 = "five";
let isPresent = false;
let firstName = "Robin";
let lastName = "Williams";
```

- What is the value of: a == str?
- What is the value of: a === str?
- What is the value of: !isPresent?
- What is the value of: (“eleven” == str2 && a >= str)?
- What is the value of: (!isPresent || isPresent)?
- What is the value of: 0 == false?
- What is the value of: 0 === false?
- What is the value of: 0 != false?
- What is the value of 0 !== false?

Use the code above to test and print the results.
